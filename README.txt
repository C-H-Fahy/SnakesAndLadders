# Snakes And Ladders

Hi!

As discussed(via Email with Barry Ip), 
I used turtle to draw the Snakes And Ladders instead of using the GIFs given, to allow
for diagonal snakes/ladders and different board sizes.

The Config can be modified to allow for different grid sizes, different sized die, 
and to change the position of the snakes and ladders.
A second example config is also included for your convienence and can be used by entering the "2"
option on startup

Ladders have priority over snakes, only one Snake/Ladder can be taken per turn

Also Turtle is strange and hates being run in IDLE on Windows on my machine,
(I wrote this on fedora workstation)but it runs perfectly fine on command line.

This may cause Turtle to non-responsive sometimes due to unknown reasons sometimes,
this seems to have nothing to do with my code.

Due to this I would recommend running it from the python command line
(which on windows is done thru just double clicking main.py)

Thank you for reading
