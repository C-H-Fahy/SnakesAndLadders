# Snakes And Ladders

Hi! This is some school project that I decided to public.

The Config can be modified to allow for different grid sizes, different sized die, 
and to change the position of the snakes and ladders.

A second example config is also included as an example.

Ladders have priority over snakes, only one Snake/Ladder can be taken per turn.

Also Turtle is strange and hates being run in IDLE on Windows on my machine,
(I wrote this on fedora workstation)but it runs perfectly fine on command line.
This may cause Turtle to non-responsive sometimes due to unknown reasons sometimes,
this seems to have nothing to do with my code.

Thank you for reading
