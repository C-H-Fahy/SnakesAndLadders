# Snakes And Ladders

Hi!

As discussed, I used turtle to draw the Snakes And Ladders instead of using the GIFs given, to allow
for diagonal snakes/ladders and variable board sizes.

The Config can be modified to allow for different board sizes, different sized die, and different sized grid.
A second example config is also included for your convienence and can be used by entering the "2" option on startup

Ladders also have priority over snakes, only one Snake/Ladder can be taken per turn

Thank you for reading
