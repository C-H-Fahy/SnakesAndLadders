# Snakes And Ladders

Hi!

As discussed, I used turtle to draw the Snakes And Ladders instead of using the GIFs given, to allow
for diagonal snakes/ladders and variable board sizes.

The Config can be modified to allow for different board sizes, different sized die, and different sized grid.
A second example config is also included for your convienence and can be used by entering the "2" option on startup

Ladders also have priority over snakes, only one Snake/Ladder can be taken per turn


Also Turtle is strange and hates being run in IDLE on Windows(I wrote this on Fedora Workstation, but tested it on windows) which may cause Turtle goes non-responsive sometimes due to unknown reasons sometimes that seem to have nothing to do with my code.

Due to this I would recommend running it from the python command line(which on windows is done thru just double clicking the SnakesAndLadders.py)

Thank you for reading
